# ![Icon Image](/Resources/notepad-grid-icon_48.png) Notepad Py
Notepad Py is a source code editor for the Python language. Its minimalist interface allows you to perform basic text editing operations faster and easier, making it suitable for editing small scripts and/or for users learning the language.

### Introduction
This project was made as a complement of my studies in Delphi and Python languages. Creating a delphi source code editor allowed me to exercise concepts of using VCL, using programming logic in developing functionalities such as Find and Replace, and explore and understand third-party components using SynEdit. Because this project also involves my first contact with the Pyhton language, some sample scripts (edited in Notepad Py) were included in the release. There are 2 simple scripts that implement some geometric calculations, a prime numbers generator, which is actually a translation of a classic example of the Pascal language, and an implementation of the Tic-tac-toe game.

### Prerequisites
Notepad Py does not require installation, just open the executable file. However, for the _Run_ commands to work correctly, you must have the Python interpreter installed and configured on the machine, that is, if the 'py' command can run on the Windows terminal, the _Run_ features on Notepad Py will also work correctly.

### Program Help
This project also has a [Wiki](https://github.com/IltonS/notepad-py/wiki) with help for the main features of the program. You can access this wiki in Notepad Py via the 'Ctrl+F1' shortcut. You can also access the official Python documentation via the 'F1' shortcut.

### Included scripts

#### Pyramid Calculator
Script that performs some geometric calculations for a rectangular base pyramid. This script uses the object-oriented programming paradigm. The calculations are:
* Height
* Base area
* Surface area
* Base length
* Base Width
* Lateral surface
* Volume

#### Square pyramidal number
This script determines whether an N number entered by the user is a square pyramidal number. That is, if with this n number it is possible to form a quadrangular pyramid. This script uses a procedural programming paradigm.

#### Prime numbers generator
Script that generates all prime numbers between 0 and 100

#### Tic-tac-toe
Implementation of the classic game. It features 1 and 2 players modes. In 1-player mode, the script does not implement any intelligence and machine moves are made randomly. In 2-players mode, the moves are done in turns, allowing two people to switch data entry.
